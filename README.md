# Demos to be converted to Unity DOTS (Data-Oriented Tech Stack)

Directions!

Clone this repository, make a new branch for your demo, then:

* Create a new directory under /PreECSDemos/Ported/ with your name. For example, /PreECSDemos/Ported/ebaumel/
* Make a brand new project in your name folder so you can start from scratch. For example, /PreECSDemos/Ported/ebaumel/DistanceFieldAttractorsECS
* Use the originals for reference, but remember we're only trying to achieve the same output. Use ECS and data-oriented design!

Difficulty Rating Outline:
* 1: Easier, no concurrent data dependencies
* 2: Moderate, concurrent reads and writes
* 3: Difficult, lots of concurrency, data design problems to solve
